This conclusion is based on the examination of the trace, which shows no identifiable signs of Slimper-specific patterns, such as consistent .js heartbeats or POST methods matching Slimper's documented paths and file naming conventions. There are standard HTTP requests and responses, along with network management traffic, but no malicious indicators corresponding to Slimper C2 framework behavior.
